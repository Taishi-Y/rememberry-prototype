Content script:
    - use "Shadow DOM" for Popup
    - use spinning loader instead of "Loading.." text
    - use "source" and "target" languages preferences from options
    - position adjustment in case when popup doesn't fit into window view-port
    - handle possible issue while new translation requested before previous was received
    - Save button should be disabled during translation loading
    - handle case when user haven't selected any term
    - add offline case (or too long response time from Google Translate API)
+   - dive into IndexedDB - there is no built-in synchronization feature
    - why do we need background page at all?
    - move to "managed" storage
    - ensure unique terms
